  				<p>O’Toole’s former wife Sian Phillips soon grew accustomed to her husband’s tendency to disappear for days with nary a word of warning. One pre-Lawrence of Arabia bender ended with him turning up on the doorstep on Christmas Day, accompanied by a brand new Morris Minor wrapped in a red ribbon. Unfortunately, he commandeered the car for a trip to Bristol shortly afterwards and wrecked it in very O’Toole fashion – he drove it into the back of a police car.</p>

  				<p>22 July 1969 <q>Dorchester Hotel. I have more or less stopped drinking and the shock to my system is obviously pretty profound. The effect at the studios [where RB is filming Anne of the Thousand Days], I mean on me, is awful. I am fundamentally so bored with my job that only drink is capable of killing the pain. The thought of doing a whole day’s work with, for instance, John Colicos [fellow actor], which is my chore tomorrow, without at least half a bottle of vodka to ease back the yawns is like deliberately inciting a nightmare. [Without drink] I have been like a mad and highly articulate bull with all kinds of people I normally have great respect for. This is par for the course when I am drinking heavily, but I’m surprised that I still do it when sober. If it is still the same in a month I shall go back to old father booze and find out how long it will take him to kill me</q></p>

  				<p>Reed – who once asked, “I like the effect drink has on me. What’s the point of staying sober?” – realised, upon his arrival at Galway airport, Ireland, while lying drunk on the baggage conveyor, that he was slowly killing himself with his constant alcohol binges. He tried to make amends for his past behaviour, which included spiking snooker star Alex Higgins’ whisky with Chanel perfume. Higgins reacted by squirting washing-up liquid in Reed’s crème de menthe.</p>
